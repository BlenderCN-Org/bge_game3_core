if you dont have blender installed, but want to try the demo, extract [Launcher 2.74 64bit EXE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-M0wZVFYV8kEPJY8vmHdeshL-o5kiNxh) to the Game folder.  
  

### DO NOT CLONE MASTER  
If you want working demo content, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/DaedalusMDW/bge_game-3.0_template/releases) and download there. The source code is generally experimental and unstable.  

Often times the "Game Data.zip" can be safely downloaded and updated manually.
